## Cost Control and Alerts

- **AWS Free Tier:** AWS offers a Free Tier with monthly limits for many services for a certain period. Be careful not to exceed these limits.

> It is **the customer's responsibility** to keep track of service changes. Recently, in July 2025, AWS changed some policies regarding the [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/free/terms/). From that date, if you create an account via IAM Identity Center, you will be directed to Organizations, which is designed for companies on a paid account modelâ€”the side effect is losing Free Tier benefits. To use an individual account and enjoy Free Tier benefits, you must create the user via regular IAM.

- **Billing Dashboard:** In the AWS Console, access the Billing Dashboard to view current spending, billing history, and details by service.

- **Budgets:** You can create budget alerts to be notified by email when you reach a certain spending amount.

- **Cost Explorer:** A visual tool to analyze and understand where your main costs are.

- **Usage Alerts:** Set up alerts to be notified when you are close to reaching the Free Tier limit or a defined budget.

- **Tip:** Always terminate resources you are not using, such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and S3 buckets, to avoid unnecessary charges.


## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud


**EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is AWS's virtual machine service, similar to VirtualBox, but scalable and managed in the cloud.

## Main concepts:

- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** The image used to initialize the instance (operating system + configurations).
    - *Image:* A binary file that represents everything stored on the volume of a virtual machine, including the OS and its settings. If you want to replicate an EC2 instance, just create or use its AMIâ€”this ensures all configurations and the environment are copied to the new instance.

- **Instance Type:** Defines CPU, memory, and network performance.
- **Storage:** You can choose network-attached (EBS & EFS) or hardware (EC2 Instance Store).
- **Security Group:** Virtual firewall that controls traffic; you use or create one as needed.
- **Key Pair:** Key used to access the instance via SSH.
- **Bootstrap Script:** Configure at first launch (EC2 user data).

> **Note:** You cannot associate a new key pair after the instance is created.
